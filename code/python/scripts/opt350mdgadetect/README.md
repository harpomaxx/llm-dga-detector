## Description:
This script uses a pre-trained causal language model to calculate the probability scores
for specific tokens ('neg' and 'pos') given a context that is influenced by a domain.
The domains are read from a CSV file.

## Key Functions:
- get_token_probability: Computes the probability of a specific token in the context provided.
- get_domain_probabilities: For a given domain, computes the probabilities of 'neg' and 'pos' tokens.
- main: Orchestrates the reading of domains from the CSV, computes their probabilities using the above functions, and optionally saves the results to a new CSV.

## Usage:
To use this script, one must provide an input CSV path with a 'domain' column, a model path, and an optional output path for results.

## Example Command:
```python
python <script_name> --csv_path domains.csv --model_path /path/to/model/dir --output_path results.csv
```

## Dependencies:
- torch: Deep learning library to work with PyTorch models.
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- transformers: Library for state-of-the-art NLP models, here specifically for loading the pre-trained causal language model and tokenizer.

Note:
The script assumes the model and data reside on a CUDA-enabled GPU device.
